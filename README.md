# Personality-Test-Clustering-for-Identifying-Similar-Traits

## Problem Statement: Personality Test Clustering for Identifying Similar Traits

In this project, a surprise personality test was conducted among a group of students, where they were asked to rate themselves on a scale of 1 to 5 across various personal and behavioral traits. The aim of the project is to analyze the results of the personality test, group students with similar personality traits, and identify patterns or similarities among individuals based on their self-assessments.

The data collected from the test was converted into a CSV format, which includes multiple columns representing different personality traits, and rows corresponding to each student's ratings. The goal is to apply hierarchical clustering techniques to group students with similar personality profiles and explore the potential clusters that arise from this analysis.

### Dataset:
- The dataset consists of multiple personality traits (columns) rated on a scale of 1-5.
- Each row corresponds to an individual student's responses.
